## Project Overview
Welcome to the CSD-310: Database and Development Use repository. This repository showcases projects and assignments focused on database design, development, and management. The core aim of this course is to build foundational knowledge and practical skills in working with databases, particularly focusing on MySQL.

The repository includes examples and exercises that demonstrate:

-Designing efficient database schemas
-Writing and executing complex SQL queries
-Creating and managing relational databases
-Implementing best practices in database development and administration

## Technologies Used
This project utilizes the following tools and technologies:

- MySQL: The main database system used for this project.
- SQL: The primary language used for writing database queries.
- Visual Studio Code: Recommended code editor with MySQL extensions for     writing and testing queries.

 ## Projects
### Schema Design
The repository contains exercises related to the design and development of relational database schemas. These exercises focus on:

-Defining entity-relationship diagrams (ERD)
-Normalization techniques (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
-Creating tables with appropriate constraints (Primary Key, Foreign Key, etc.)

### Query Creation
Develop complex SQL queries for real-world data extraction and manipulation:

-CRUD Operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete
-Aggregations, Joins, and Subqueries
-Data filtering and sorting with WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY

## Installation
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that the following tools are installed on your system:

-MySQL Server: You can download it from the official MySQL website.
